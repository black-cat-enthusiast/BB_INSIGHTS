<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since it was first introduced during season 7, OTEV has been played every season except for season 10.</li>
<li>Each season OTEV has appearead as a different wacky character, but the fundamentals of the game have remained consistent.</li>
</ul>

<div id="key-insights-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>71% of OTEV winners have been male.
<ul>
<li><em>Question arrising: Have equal proportions of males and females played OTEV over the years?</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="interpretation" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>OTEV is a physical competition that relies heavilly on upper body strength. It is therefore not surprising that male houseguests tend to win this competition over females.</li>
</ul>
