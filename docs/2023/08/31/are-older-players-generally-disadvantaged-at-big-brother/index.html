<h2>Interpretations:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visual inspection of the distribution of players indicates that most BBUS houseguests are in their mid-late 20’s during the filming of their seasons.</li>
<li>The distribution of BBUS houseguests’ ages is “right-skewed”, indicating that the mean overestimates central tendency (and the median is a better measure of the average houseguest age in this case).
<ul>
<li>The mean age of BBUS houseguests is 29.13 years, whereas the median player age is 27 (plotted as vertical dashed lines above).</li>

<h2>Interpretations:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The average age has not been changing systematically across the 25 seasons of BBus.</li>
<li>The “right skew” in the histogram above is evident most seasons:
<ul>
<li>The majority of houseguests are clustered in their 20’s with 2-3 players &gt; 35 years each season.</li>

<h1>Interpretations:</h1>
