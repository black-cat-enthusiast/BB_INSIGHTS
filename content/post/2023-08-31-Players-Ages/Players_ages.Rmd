##  Key Insights:

- Visual inspection of the distribution of players indicates that most BBUS houseguests are in their mid-late 20's during the filming of their seasons. 
- The distribution of BBUS houseguests' ages is "right-skewed", indicating that the mean overestimates central tendency (and the median is a better measure of the average houseguest age in this case). 
    + The mean age of BBUS houseguests is 29.13 years, whereas the median player age is 27 (plotted as vertical dashed lines above). 

# Graph Houseguests' Ages Each Season

```{r,fig.cap='Data plotted as mean value +/- SEM. The red line represents the median player age of 27 years.'}

## Key Insights:

- The average age has not been changing systematically across the 25 seasons of BBus. 
- The "right skew" in the histogram above is evident most seasons: 
    + The majority of houseguests are clustered in their 20's with 2-4 players > 35 years each season.

## Key Insights:

- BBUS winners are not significantly younger than the median player age of 27.

ages_linear
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
a <- lm(finish_num~age_i,data=data)
summary(a)
```


#  Key Insights:

- Age of player is not a significant linear predictor of which week they will be evicted from the BBUS house. 
- Player's age accounted for less than 1% of the variability observed in eviction week (F(1,352) = 0.05, *p* = 0.8))

#### The slope of the red line is not singificantly different than 0, indicating that there is not evidence to support the hypothesis that younger players get evicted systematically earlier than younger players..
