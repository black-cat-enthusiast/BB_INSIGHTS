# Question: Is winning the first HOH good or bad for players' games? 

- Players often mention that they don't want to win the first HOH, as not to "put a target on their back". 
- *Is there systematic evidence to support an effect of winning the first HOH on game outcomes?* (Explored below)

# Graph where each first HOH placed on thir season of BBUS: 
```{r, fig.cap="Each week 1 HOH's final place on their season of BBUs. The starting point of the grey line reperesents the number of players on each season"}
first_HOH_data <- read_csv("First_HOH.csv")

a <- first_HOH_data %>%
  arrange(Season) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Place,y=Season))+
  geom_segment(aes(x=Number,xend=Place,y=Season,yend=Season),size=2,colour="lightgrey")+
  geom_point(size=5,colour="#800020",alpha=0.4)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 2:24)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:17)+
  labs(
    x = "Place on their season of BBUS",
    y = "Seasons of BBUS",
    title = "Curse of the first HOH winner?",
    subtitle = "Actually, 5 of 24 first HOH winners have won the game."
  )

First_HOH_graph <-  a + 
  geom_text(aes(x=Place,y=Season,label=First_HOH),check_overlap = TRUE)+
  scale_x_reverse(breaks=1:17)

First_HOH_graph
```

### Key Insights: 

- Five week 1 HOH's have gone on to win their season of big brother. 
    + Therefore, winning the first HOH does not appear to be deteremental to player's games. 

# Plot week 1 HOH winner's outcomes in BBUS as a histogram: 
```{r. fig.cap="The number of week 1 HOHs (x-axis that finished in each possible place (y-axis) on their season of BBUS."}
data <- first_HOH_data %>%
  group_by(Place) %>%
  mutate(num_dum  = 1:length(Place))

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=Place))+
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.3)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(1:17))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  labs(
    x="Number of Week 1 HOHs",
    y="Place on their season of BBUS",
    title = "First Place is the most common outcome for week 1 HOH winners"
  )+
  geom_text(aes(x=num_dum,y=Place, label=First_HOH),size=4,colour="#800020")
```

### Key Insights: 
- First place is the most common finish for week 1 HOH winners. 
- 40% of week 1 HOHs finish between 1st and 4th place 
  + (McCrae,Caleb,Janelle,Jerry,Typer,Lisa,Hayden,Rachel,Nicole,Cody)

# Investigae how far in the game week 2 winners last:
```{r}
second_HOH_data <- read_csv("Second_HOH.csv")

a <- second_HOH_data %>%
  arrange(Season) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Place,y=Season))+

    y = "Seasons of BBUS",
    title = "Curse of the second HOH winner?",
    subtitle = "No player that has won the second HOH has gone on to win the game."
  )
Second_HOH_graph <-  a + 
  geom_text(aes(x=Place,y=Season,label=Second_HOH),check_overlap = TRUE)+
  scale_x_reverse(breaks=c(1:17))

Second_HOH_graph
```

### Key Insights:
- No week 2 HOH has gone on to win their season of BBUS. 
- Only 3 / 24 (12%) week 2 HOHs have made it to the final 4 on their season.

# Plot week 1 HOH winner's outcomes in BBUS as a histogram: 
```{r}
data <- second_HOH_data %>%
  group_by(Place) %>%
  mutate(num_dum  = 1:length(Place))

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=Place))+
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.3)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(1:17))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  labs(
    x="Number of Week 1 HOHs",
    y="Place on their season of BBUS",
    title = "First Place is the most common outcome for week 1 HOH winners"
  )+

```

# Calculate odds of winning BB for week 1 HOHs 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Chance odds of winning Big brother
bb_odds <- 1/mean(first_HOH_data$Number)

# Odds of winning BB after winning the FIRST HOH
first_HOH_odds <- 5/24

# Odds of eviction during week 2 after winning week 1 HOH
week_two_eviction_odds <- 2/24

# Week 1 winner's odds of winning their season / chance
Relative_odds <- first_HOH_odds / bb_odds
Relative_odds
# Week 1 winner's odds of eviction the following week / chance. 
Relative_odds_2 <- week_two_eviction_odds / bb_odds
Relative_odds_2

Relative_odds_3 <- first_HOH_odds / week_two_eviction_odds
Relative_odds_3
```

### Key Insights 
- Winners of the first HOH competition are 3x more likely than chance odds to win their season of BBUS. 
- First week HOH's are 20% more likly to go home the following week than chance, but,
- Week 1 HOH winners are 2.5x more likely to win the game than to go home in week 2. 

# Calculate odds of finishing within the final 4 for winners of the first / second HOH
- Cannot calculate odds of winning becauese no one who has won week 2 HOH has gone one to win! 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Chance odds of placing in the top 3 on BBUS
bb_top_4_odds <- 4/mean(first_HOH_data$Number)

# Odds of placing within the top 4 after winning the FIRST HOH
first_HOH_top4_odds <- 10/24
second_HOH_top4_odds <- 3/24

# Week 1 winner's odds of placing within the top 4 / chance
first_HOH_Relative_odds <- first_HOH_top4_odds / bb_top_4_odds
first_HOH_Relative_odds

# SECOND HOH's chance of placing within top 4 / chance. 
second_HOH_Relative_odds <- second_HOH_top4_odds / bb_top_4_odds
second_HOH_Relative_odds

Relative_odds_3 <- first_HOH_Relative_odds / second_HOH_Relative_odds
Relative_odds_3
```

### Key Insights:
- Winners of week 1 HOH are 50% more likely than chance to end up in the final 4 on their season.
- Winning week 2 HOH is associated with a 55% reduction in probability of making it to the final 4 on their season. 
- Winners of week 1 are 3.33x more likely than winners of week 2 to make it to the top 4. 

### **Overall take-away: houseguests should gun for that 1st HOH!!!**
