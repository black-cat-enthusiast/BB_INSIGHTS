<div id="questions-arising" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions arising:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Have equal number of males / females been nominated during week #1?</p></li>
<li><p>Do males go out week 1 more often than females?</p></li>
<li><p>Does winning the veto (or having another player use their veto win) drive females’ surviving week 1 nomination?</p></li>
