### Key Insights:
- Since it was first introduced during season 7, OTEV has been played every season except for season 10. 
- Each season OTEV has appearead as a different wacky character, but the fundamentals of the game have remained consistent.

### Key Insights: 
- The only OTEV winner that has gone on to win BBUS in Cody during (sm)all stars (season 22).
- Houseguests seem to last for several weeks on average after OTEV

```{r,fig.cap="Mean number of weeks that OTEV winners last after winning OTEV. Data plotted as mean value +/- Standard error of the mean with individual data points overlaid."}
a <- data %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(Post_OTEV_weeks),
    sd=sd(Post_OTEV_weeks),
  ) %>% mutate(se = sd / sqrt(n-1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=mean))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",alpha=0.2)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=n,ymin=mean-se,ymax=mean+se),width=0.25)+

# Male vs female OTEV winners
```{r}

  group_by(Sex)%>%
  summarise(
    n=n()
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Sex,y=n,colour=Sex,fill=Sex))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",alpha=0.2)+
  geom_text(aes(x=Sex,y=1,label=n))+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("#CD5E77","#89CFF0"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CD5E77","#89CFF0"))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Female \n OTEV winners","Male \n OTEV winners"))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))+
  labs(x="",
       y="Number of OTEV Winners",
       title="Male Houseguests win OTEV more often than females")

OTEV_sex_graph
```

### Key Insights:
- 71% of OTEV winners have been male. 
    + *Question arrising: Have equal proportions of males and females played OTEV over the years?*

### Interpretation: 
- OTEV is a physical competition that relies heavilly on upper body strength. It is therefore not surprising that male houseguests tend to win this competition over females.
